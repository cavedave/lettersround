# Chapter: Unsticky Words

Some words just won’t stick. You’ve seen them five times, you’ve missed them five times. They vanish under pressure, blur into noise, or simply refuse to lodge in memory.

This chapter is your **rescue plan** — and your **logbook**.

Use it as a space to collect the words that keep slipping away from you. For each one, you’ll walk through a few steps to give it another chance to anchor itself.
