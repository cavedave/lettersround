# Chapter 10 â€” Strategy Deep Dive: The AEINST Anagram Family

Welcome to our most advanced strategy chapter. Here, we move beyond themed words to explore a concept that is a true force multiplier in Countdown: **deep anagram families**.

The six letters **A, E, I, N, S, T** are some of the most common in English. When they appear together, they form the foundation for a huge number of 7- and 8-letter words. By adding just one or two extra letters to this core set, you can unlock dozens of high-scoring plays.

In this chapter, we'll start with two key 7-letter words, **ATONIES** and **RETSINA**, and then explore the massive family of 8-letter words that can be built from their letters. Mastering this group will train you to see not just one word, but a whole universe of possibilities in a letter selection.
