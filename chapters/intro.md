# Welcome to Countdown Word Mastery

This booklet helps you learn and retain 100 of the most useful words for the Countdown letters round — especially 8- and 9-letter words that frequently appear or unlock high-scoring plays.

### How It Works

Each day, you'll:
- Learn **8 new words** through definitions and scrambles.
- Reinforce them through **puzzles, word searches, and anagrams**.
- Review previous words using spaced repetition (Day 1, 3, 7, etc.).

The exercises are short, but they build toward **mastery and quick recall** — ideal for both casual players and serious competitors.

> 📆 Review-only days are spaced every few days to keep memory fresh.  
> ✍️ Tip: Use the Notes sections to add mnemonics, personal clues, or pronunciation hints.
