## 1.2 Why Learn and Practise 100 Words

After completing the challenges in this book, you wonâ€™t just score more points in Countdown, youâ€™ll have mastered the practical benefits of spaced repetition. Youâ€™ll learn how to apply and refresh knowledge at timed intervals, a skill you can transfer to any challenge or learning task in your life.


About 15% of letters rounds will match one of the words in this book. Over a ten round full game that is one and a half times per episode you will see one of these words. Finding a one of these seven or eight letter words consistantly in an episode might not increase your score at home from the 5 or 6 letter word you would have found without the book. But Declaring 'Aeneous' is going to impress anyone watching with you.

## 1.2 What Learning and Practise Means â€“ and How Much It Helps

[Spaced repetition theory and practice]

To remember soemthing you must first pay attention to it. Then you have to refresh your memory of it a few times and it will stay.

We forget things quickly. Or at least we used to until the Forgetting Curve was discovered.

You improve most quickly by focussed practice. This book is to help you focus on the most useful skill in Countdown. Recognising really common letters patterns when they occur. 

## 1.3 How to Use This Book

This is a physical book for a reason. The reason is so that you can write on it, throw it around and in general feel it and not be on a screen. 

Take the space below and scribble on it. Then the book is written on and you wont feel guilty about filling in the puzzles.
If you dont want to just scribble try answer these questions to get your head in the space of useful words. 

Can you think of any words that might be in the top 100?
What letters do you think will be common starting ones. Any ending you expect to see often?
Will many of the words look consonant heavy like 'lynx' or vowel heavy like 'audio'?
